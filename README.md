# Network Testing Suite

Tool for testing network communication protocols, written in C++.

## Overview

Writing network code is complicated. This library aims to improve the situation by enabling the development of tests to check whether a network communication protocol is correctly implemented.

The main features offered by this library include:

- Support for multiple communication protocols (UDP, TCP, IPv4, Ethernet).
- Linear test construction and flow (no callback hell).
- Batteries included configuration and logging.

*Disclaimer: This project is still highly experimental, and makes no guarantees of correctly supporting these features, at this time.*
